        <h2 class="h2">What is FLOWGORITHM?</h2>
        <p class="means">Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool which allows users to 
            <br>write and execute programs using flowcharts. The approach is designed to 
            <br>emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a specific programming language. 
             <br> The flowchart can be converted to several major programming languages<br>
             <br>Flowgorithm is a free beginner's programming language that is based on simple graphical flowcharts.<br>
             <br>Typically, when a student first learns to program, they often use one of the text-based programming languages.
             <br> Depending on the language, this can either be easy or frustratingly difficult. Many languages require you to write 
              <br>lines of confusing code just to display the text "Hello, world!".<br>
              <br>By using flowcharts, you can concentrate on programming concepts rather than all the nuances of a typical programming 
               <br>language. You can also run your programs directly in Flowgorithm. <br>
               <br>Once you understand programming logic, it is easy for you to learn one of the major languages. Flowgorithm can interactively convert 
              <br>your flowchart to over 18 languages. These include: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby, Swift, Visual Basic .NET, and VBA (used in Office).<br>
             <br> Flowgorithm combines the classic flowchart symbols and those used by SDL diagrams. The color of each shape is shared by the associated 
             <br>generated code and the console window. The colors can be changed to several built-in themes. As of version 2.22.1 Flowgorithm lacks break and continue statements making it impossible to create more complex algorithms. </p>
