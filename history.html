      <h1 class="def">HISTORY OF FLOWCHART AND ALGORITHM</h1>
        <h2 class="h2">Who invented flowchart?</h2>
        <p class="means">The flow process chart was originally introduced by Frank Gilbreth in 1921 
            <br>as a structured method for documenting process flow, in his presentation “Process Charts, 
            <br>First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to Do Work.” Gilbreth’s tools quickly found their 
            <br>way into industrial engineering curricula (Wikipedia). With the advancement of 
            <br>information technology, the flow charts have been applied extensively using most of 
            <br>the symbols as illustrated.</p>
        
            <h2 class="h2">Who invented Algorithm?</h2>
        <p class="means">The World's 1st Computer Algorithm, Written by Ada Lovelace, Sells for $125,000 
            <br>at Auction. Young Ada Lovelace was introduced to English society as the sole (legitimate) 
            <br>child of scalawag poet Lord Byron in 1815. More than 200 years later, she is remembered 
            <br>by many as the first programmer in the history of computing. </p>
