      <h1 class="def">FLOWCHART BASIC PROCEDURE</h1>
        <p class="means">1. Define the process to be diagrammed. Write its title at the top of the work surface.<br>
           <br> 2. Discuss and decide on the boundaries of your process: Where or when does the process start? 
             <br>Where or when does it end? Discuss and decide on the level of detail to be included in the diagram.<br>
           <br> 3. Brainstorm the activities that take place. Write each on a card or sticky note.<br>
           <br> 4. Arrange the activities in proper sequence.<br>
            <br>5.When all activities are included and everyone agrees that the sequence is correct, 
            <br>draw arrows to show the flow of the process.<br>
            <br>6.Review the flowchart with others involved in the process<br>
            (workers, supervisors, suppliers, customers) to see if they agree that the process is drawn accurately. </p>

      <h1 class="def">FLOWCHART CONSIDERATIONS</h1>
        <p class="means"> 1. Donâ€™t worry about drawing the flowchart the "right way." Ultimately,
             <br>the right way is the way that helps those involved understand the process.<br>
            <br>2.Identify and involve in the flowcharting process all key people involved with the process. 
            <br>This includes suppliers, customers, and supervisors. Involve them in the actual flowcharting
            <br>sessions by interviewing them before the sessions and/or by showing them the developing flowchart 
            <br>between work sessions and obtaining their feedback.<br>
            <br>3.Do not assign a "technical expert" to draw the flowchart. People who actually perform the process
             <br> should do it. </p>
