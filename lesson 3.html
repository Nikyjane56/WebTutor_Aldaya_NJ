      <h1 class="def">PROCEDURE OF ALGORITHM</h1>
        <h2 class="h2">An Algorithm Development Process</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Step 1: Obtain a description of the problem.</h3>
        <p class="means">This step is much more difficult than it appears.
            <br> In the following discussion, the word client refers to someone 
            <br>who wants to find a solution to a problem, and the word developer 
            <br>refers to someone who finds a way to solve the problem. The developer
            <br>must create an algorithm that will solve the client's problem. </p>
        
        <h3 class="h3">Step 2: Analyze the problem.</h3>
        <p class="means">The purpose of this step is to determine both the starting 
                <br> and ending points for solving the problem. 
                <br> This process is analogous to a mathematician determining what is given and what must
                <br>be proven. A good problem description makes it easier to perform this step. </p>
        
        <h3 class="h3">Step 3: Develop a high-level algorithm.</h3>
        <p class="means">An algorithm is a plan for solving a problem,
                <br>but plans come in several levels of detail. It's usually 
                <br> better to start with a high-levelalgorithm that includes the major part of a solution, but leaves
                <br> the details until later. We can use an everyday example to demonstrate a high-level algorithm.</p>

        <h3 class="h3_l">Step 4: Refine the algorithm by adding more detail.</h3>
        <p class="left">When our goal is to develop algorithms that will lead to computer programs,
                        <br>we need to consider the capabilities of the computer and provide enough 
                        <br>detail so that someone else could use our algorithm to write a computer 
                        <br>program that follows the steps in our algorithm.</p>
                        
        <h3 class="h3_2">Step 5: Review the algorithm.</h3>
        <p class="lefts">The final step is to review the algorithm.First, we need to work through 
                     <br>the algorithm step by step to determine whether or not it will solve the original problem.
                     <br>Once we are satisfied that the algorithm does provide a solution to the problem, 
                     <br>dwe start to look for other things.</p>
