        <h2 class="Hommie">HELLO STUDENTS</h2>
         <p class="classy">As a pre-service teacher of ICT, I chose this topic because it will help us to understand the importance of flowchart and algorithm in programming. 
                         Flowchart and algorithm is essential to start learning programming by learning the step by step process. 
                         <br>This website will help to better understand the flowchart and algorithm through tutorials and information. <br>
                         <br> The information and tutorials that have been shared are a great help to me to have a broad knowledge of making flowcharts and algorithms. It is my idea to make content on this website so that I can share what I have learned and tutorials 
                         <br>that will help ICT students especially when it comes to programming.</p>
